# From Physics to Data Science

## Introduction
Hi you! I'm Philipp, a young physicist within nuclear medicine and a data science enthusiast. I have only recently begun my career in data science, after having browsed through courses on DataCamp and Codecademy. But given my solid background in mathematics, I find that courses like this don't provide me with much. Hence I am seeking to learning data science through "*learning by doing*".

This portfolio is a representation of my GitHub repository **Data-Science-Projects**, where I plan to upload everything data-science related.
